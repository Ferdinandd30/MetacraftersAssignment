# IoT Smart Contract - README

## Overview

This is a simple Solidity smart contract named "iot" that keeps track of milk bottles and egg crates. 

It is designed to be deployed and interacted with using the Remix Solidity IDE.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with this smart contract using Remix, follow these steps:

1. **Open Remix**: Visit the Remix web-based IDE at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. **Create a New File**:
   - Click on the "+" button in the file explorer panel to create a new file.
   - Name the file `iot.sol` and paste the contract code into it.

3. **Compile the Contract**:
   - In the Solidity Compiler tab, select the version "0.8.18" from the dropdown (or the version you prefer).
   - Click the "Compile" button to compile the contract. Ensure that there are no compilation errors.

4. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - In the Deploy & Run Transactions tab, select "iot" from the contract dropdown.
   - Configure the deployment settings as needed (e.g., gas limit).
   - Click the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract to a local or test network.

5. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - In the same Deploy & Run Transactions tab, you can interact with the deployed contract by calling the `getMilk` and `getEggs` functions.
   - Enter the required parameters (e.g., amount) and click the respective function's button to execute the function.

6. **View Contract State**:
   - You can check the state variables `milkBottles` and `eggCrates` to see the updated counts after interacting with the contract.

## Contract Details

- `milkBottles`: A public state variable that stores the count of milk bottles.
- `eggCrates`: A public state variable that stores the count of egg crates.

The contract provides two functions for interaction:
- `getMilk(uint amount)`: Allows users to add milk bottles to the count.
- `getEggs(uint amount)`: Allows users to add egg crates to the count.
